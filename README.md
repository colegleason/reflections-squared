The Data
========
We have hand-compiled a list of speakers and talks from the Reflections | Projections conference throughout the years. The types of data collected is below:

Speakers:
* Name
* Age at time of talk
* Highest Degree at time of talk
* Place that degree was earned
* Gender
* Affiliated Organization at time of talk
* Talk Subject (hand coded)
* Talk Title
* Talk Abstract

If we could not find the data, that field was left blank.
