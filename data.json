Mathematical entities which can be used to model systems as simple as a vending machine and as complex as any computer, FSMs can be used in a wide range of applications such as particle accelerators, inventory tracking, and computer music. During this presentation, the audience will learn: The definition of abstract state machines, The use of state machines for analysis and design, and The use of state machines for structuring computer software code.",

Our idea is to give a bit of insight into the music industry - and other stuff we've picked up over the years - that you won't learn in school. Our whole method for everything we do adheres to the \"DIY Ethic\" - the 'Do It Yourself' method of accomplishing your goals. Participants can expect to hear a little bit about the music industry, a little bit about how to survive financially when you want to pursue your dreams, a little bit about freelancing and how we\ufffdre starting to go about getting jobs, a little about how to build your own studio, a little about how to start a record label, put out your own record or CD-ROM, and a tiny bit of our philosophy on \"getting ahead by being different.\"",

This talk explores the relationship between mechanical locks and cryptology with an emphasis on how the abstract security models more usually associated with computing systems can be used to analyze and attack physical security systems as well. We describe attacks against masker-keyed mechanical pin tumbler locks that exploit weaknesses remarkably similar to those found in badly-designed cryptographic protocols. We end with future directions for research in this area and the suggestion that mechanical locks are worthy objects of our attention and scrutiny. A recent research paper on this subject is available online at: http://www.crypto.com/papers/mk.pdf",

These methods include Kerberos which is in wide use on Windows 2000 and Unix systems, and the Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) from the Globus Project. In these methods the user's long term secret is never transmitted over the network. Instead credentials are delegated from system to system. This allows for multi-tiered or Grid computing environments where the delegated credentials are used to authenticate on a user's behalf to other systems. For example a token can be automatically obtained by the SSH daemon to access files in the AFS distributed file system.",

Unfortunately, many of the new computerized voting systems being purchased today have major security and reliability problems.  Anyone who doubts the result of an election is now obliged to prove that those results are inaccurate. But paper ballots, the main evidence that would provide that proof, are being eliminated. Vendors and election officials are free to claim that elections have gone \ufffdsmoothly,\ufffd when there is no way for a voter to ascertain whether the ballot cast was recorded or tabulated correctly by the voting system. Furthermore, the new equipment does not provide any way to perform an independent audit, so the idea of a recount is becoming meaningless.

Cilk minimally extends the C programming language to allow interactions among computational threads to be specified in a simple and high-level fashion. Cilk's provably efficient runtime system dynamically maps a user's program onto available physical resources using a \"work-stealing\" scheduler, freeing the programmer from concerns of communication protocols and load balancing. In addition, Cilk provides an abstract performance model that a programmer can use to predict the multiprocessor performance of his application from its execution on a single processor. Not only do Cilk programs scale up to run efficiently on multiple processors, but unlike many existing parallel-programming environments, Cilk programs \"scale down\": the efficiency of a Cilk program on one processor rivals that of a comparable C program. In this talk, Mr. Leiserson will provide a brief tutorial on the Cilk language. He will explain how to program multithreaded applications in Cilk and how to analyze their performance. He will also illustrate some of the ideas behind Cilk using the example of MIT's championship computer-chess programs, *Socrates and Cilkchess. In addition, he will briefly sketch how the software technology underlying Cilk works.",

Things have improved more than a thousand-fold. Is this true of teaching as well as technology? What are the differences between java.util.Random, java.security.SecureRandom, and the random numbers available from random.org? How does this this question relate to the previous question?

They've now surpassed CPUs as the highest-performing compute engine in a computer, and the performance difference is continuing to widen. As they've moved to 32-bit floating-point math, they've also now become practical for other kinds of computations, from signal processing, to fluid dynamics, to financial simulation. In this presentation, we will look at an overview of the graphics pipeline, and see how it can now be viewed as a more generic parallel processor of streams of floating-point data. We'll also talk about how the programming model is likely to evolve, so that software engineers can express the parallelism within their algorithms more efficiently, both for GPUs, and for the upcoming wave of multi-core CPUs.",

It's also hard to persuade people to share their PC. But the magnitude of the resource - roughly 100 million privately-owned PCs on the Internet today - makes it tempting to try, and projects like GIMPS, distributed.net and SETI@home have demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. We are currently developing BOINC, a software platform for public distributed computing. BOINC will support a wide range of applications, including those with large storage or communication requirements. Independent BOINC projects can share overlapping resource pools, and participants can control the sharing of their resources.",

The idea is to define a set of rules for how particles are emitted, how they evolve, etc. and then let the system run on its own, as opposed to having an artist model each particle individually. The problem is that procedurally evolving systems can consume large amounts of CPU power, so particle systems tend to be coded as efficiently as possible. This greatly reduces the flexibility of the system, meaning that only a small number of fairly primitive parameters are available to the animator. When more sophisticated behaviors are desired generally a programmer will code the system ad hoc. In many games developing custom particle systems becomes a serious bottleneck. We have designed and developed an interesting particle system technology which is designed to be flexible enough to allow an amazing amount of customization without the need of any coding at all, while still being efficient enough to be used in production material. Additionally, we have created a tool which allows comprehensive, real-time, hands on authoring of procedural systems, enabling even moderately technical artists to create particle system \"presets\" which can then be attached to game entities or events and triggered as needed.",

New forms of social software and customer relations management are appearing on the Web. Objects can be designed for disassembly and turned into smart trash.

Blogs, now numbering in the millions, are web pages updated using blogging software that makes it easy for authors to share new content online in the form of time-stamped posts. One can track how a piece of information spreads by observing when it appears on different blogs. The exact route the information takes is not obvious, since most blog authors will not explicitly identify the source of the information when they write about it. Likely routes can be inferred, however, by analyzing timing information, blogs' past entries, and the explicit network of blogs linking to one another through blogrolls or posts. While one can gain insights from observing how information passes from one individual to another, one can also analyze networks to see how easily one can actively navigate them to locate needed information or individuals. One test of the navigability of a network is the classic small world experiment, where subjects attempt to reach a target individual through their chain of acquaintances. Examining an email network within an organization reveals how individuals are capable of routing messages locally, even though their knowledge of the organization's global social network is limited.",

Using traditional security strategies, this is true. This is a tragic irony, for security engineering and usability design have the same goal: to ensure that the user is never unpleasantly surprised. Security and usability cannot be traded off, they must be integrated. This presentation will demonstrate new user friendly security technologies under development at HP. The Polaris desktop overlay makes Windows safe against several important cyberattacks. The Web Calculus enables easy and secure sharing of data across the Web. Both systems eliminate passwords, access control lists, obscure certificates, funny dialog boxes, and other popular hindrances to usability. Both Polaris and Web Calculus are derived from the same radical architecture for secure computing -- the Authorization Based Access Control model, a model of secure computing for those of us who are not computer security gurus.",

No place is this more apparent than on the modern battlefield--business or government. The task of the analyst planner is to observe, discern, and report on patterns of events that can explain why or how; more clearly describe what is; and predict when and what is to come--situational understanding. The effectiveness of decision makers is largely dependent on the quality (breadth and depth) of this analysis. The patterns of events of interest are often hidden in the vast quantity of information--in its myriad forms and modes of transfer. These patterns are also obscured by the ever quickening pace of information flows, including an ever growing abundance of noise. The presentation will describe the process and relevant technology required to support situational understanding--in business or government.",

This talk will describe how grid computing and utility computing are taking shape within Morgan Stanley. It will provide the business context under which these technologies are being used today and discuss the technical challenges that lie ahead. Much progress has been made in developing a common grid framework for developing and deploying CPU hungry applications; however, there is still a big challenge left in dealing with CPU and other resource \"fragmentation\". Virtualization is a key emerging technology that can be leveraged to utilize resources more efficiently.",

It is my hope that those who attend will be inspired not only to follow a career in computer science but to do so while thinking outside the box and applying their skills to solving society's challenges. Computers are tools to be used solve much more interesting and complex problems in life. Computer science is one of the greatest fields to choose as a career because your skills can be applied to just about any problem domain from education to genetic sequencing to space exploration to modern dance to health care. A successful career requires the understanding not only of computer science techniques but also the problem domain to which they are applied. It is this application of computer science which in my opinion makes being a computer scientist or engineer the greatest occupation the world has ever known.",

Abstraction, which has been used until now, is becoming increasingly inadequate as microelectronic chips approach a billion transistors. We can learn from biology, which handles complexity through developmental processes that elaborate a relatively simple starting recipe into a complex mature structure. By borrowing from biology, we have developed two self-configuring microelectronic chips. These chips capture the ability of epigenetic development to generate representations of features in neural layers and to autoroute connections between these layers. This metamorphic approach provides a powerful alternative to handling complexity in nanoelectronic systems.",

AARON was a drawing program, its structure loosely following the then-current \u201cexpert system\u201d paradigm, that exhibited a distinctive \u201cart personality\u201d of its own, and the program\u2014not just its output\u2014was widely exhibited during its first ten years. Of the many thousands of original drawings it generated, some were colored by hand and a few turned into paintings and murals. The problem of having a sightless program control something as fundamentally visual as color appeared intractable, however, and it was the mid-eighties before the first rule-based version showed that it might be possible. It took twenty years more for AARON to become the world-class colorist it is today. This talk provides some background on the technology of color control, and presents an overview of how the program's expertise developed, resting finally upon a change from the implicit representation of knowledge in the rules provided by the author, to the explicit representation of that knowledge in structures made available to the program itself. That change has made it possible to replace the program's extensive rule-base with a remarkably simple algorithm that not only performs as well as the previous rule-intensive versions, but commands a much wider range of coloring strategies.",

Moreover, they have limited on-board maneuvering energy. They are therefore subject to relatively modest dynamic limits-maximum angular velocities, accelerations, and \u201cjerks\u201d (time derivatives of acceleration). The process of maneuvering such a vehicle to point its sensors at a sequence of targets, particularly if these are close together, cannot be modeled accurately without accounting for the effects of these limits. The duration of such a maneuver (\u201cslewing and settling\u201d) is not readily computable in closed form, because the vehicle moves some distance during the maneuver, affecting the required rotation angle. Assuming that the maneuver is a planar rotation enables constructing an iterative algorithm to resolve these coupled quantities. Combining vector calculus and simple physics in a Newton's-method formulation, this algorithm is implemented in about 100 lines of C++, and can compute about 80,000 maneuver-times per second on current PC hardware. Millions of such computations are required when analyzing and generating collection schedules. The \u201cslew model\u201d described is embedded in IISYS (the Integrated Intelligence Systems Simulator), which is used by SAIC to analyze system architectures, concepts of operation, and their interrelationships for the National Reconnaissance Office. Staffed mainly by Air Force and CIA personnel, the NRO is the U. S. Government's executive agency for space-based reconnaissance (\u201cspy satellites\u201d).

This factoring will tend to cut across established silos and the solution will tend to incorporate techniques and architectures found in classically separate areas of computer science scholarship and research. Palantir is actively engaged in building these conceptual information systems. In this talk, Ari Gordon-Schlosberg will explore the historical context of HCS as a system design philosophy, explore how its goals are very different from what AI tried and failed to accomplish, and present some real world examples of how HCS builds better information systems.",

Every interaction we have with our laptops, web applications, and file shares will be intercepted and emulated through hypervisors: thin layers of software that allow a single silicon CPU core to pretend to multiple virtual machines. And attackers who can negotiate the barriers between physical and virtual machines will seize sweeping powers to steal data, infect computers, and hide their presence. Enterprise IT is a key theater in the three-front war being fought between information security teams and organized crime. If the enterprise falls, attackers will ignore web application security and harvest identities and bank accounts directly from the source. If the enterprise falls, attackers will ignore DRM and steal high-definition DVD masters or game source code right off of corporate file servers. And every enterprise IT team in the world is migrating to virtualized servers. Is the sky falling? My team tried to find out. In 2006, we developed a proof-of-concept rootkit programmed directly to the hardware virtualization features of the Intel chipset. In 2007, we spent a year in a high-tech sparring match with ultra-clever security researcher Joanna Rutkowska, author of the \"Blue Pill\" hypervisor rootkit for AMD, whose research goal is the creation of undetectable stealth malware. Our talk is a deep dive into virtualization technology and computer security. We'll show how hypervisors work, and how we used those concepts to invent \"hyperjacking\", which virtualizes a running operating system out from under itself. Then we'll explain how antivirus software can detect a hyperjacker just as easily as a kernel virus. And we'll explain how a Google researcher may have opened the floodgates to vulnerabilities that will plague hypervisor kernels for years to come, and why local crypto timing attacks mean you shouldn't take credit cards on a shared Xen web server. You'll get some perspective on how information security interacts with operating system theory, and, perhaps unexpectedly, come to see virtualization as a win for security.",

It will then briefly and selectively survey the recent history and current state of the discipline at the intersection of computer science and the humanities--\"digital humanities\" scholarship--with a view to showing how things can go spectacularly wrong when the aforementioned physical attributes are (mis)cast as the unfortunate \"constraints\" and \"limitations\" of an outmoded \"information medium.\" The talk will conclude with a set of specific recommendations for recreating in the digital realm the aspects of manuscripts and books that are the most critically productive for humanities scholarship.",

Fueled by recent advances in processor virtualization technologies, software developers continue to propose new uses for virtual machines. So what's with all the hype? Are virtual machines really the answer to many of today's computing problems? In his talk, Eric Traut will discuss the basic concepts involved in machine virtualization and provide an architectural overview of Microsoft's soon-to-be-released hypervisor.

As a result, people are used very inefficiently; school taxes and tuition are becoming progressively more outlandish. But it is not all that easy to figure out where to apply automation in education. We shall try to sort out where people are needed and where machines can be adequate substitutes. We then turn to college-level education, especially in Computer Science. Are textbooks a thing of the past? Does the ability of schools to pipe lectures into the dorms radically change the economics of education?

All bugs are patched and reported upstream, meaning the process not only improves the security and robustness of OpenBSD, but also that of the individual applications. For example, using ProPolice, a gcc modification that catches stack-smashing problems, we were able to detect many potentially exploitable bugs at runtime.

Perhaps the biggest surprise has been its excellent performance, the result of a decade of tuning and compiler optimizations by the Rhino open-source dev team. In this talk I'll give a high-level overview of life using JavaScript as a replacement for Java (specifically in the context of our Ruby on Rails port), followed by a deep dive into the Rhino runtime and byte compiler.

Indeed, it is often quite hard to see what the substantive claims of computational linguistics are, and how one's model could be falsified (other than by presenting another model that has a lower error rate). Part of the problem is that a large amount of what counts as computational linguistics is essentially natural language engineering, where the point is simply to find something that works. And part of the problem is a widespread view that has computational linguistics as little more than applied machine learning. Nonetheless, there are models and problems that serve as unifying themes in the field. Among these are the widespread use of finite-state methods, recent work on grammar induction and the growing field of computational modeling of evolutionary language change. Each of these is interesting not only as a computational problem, but also because of the light it may shed on human language.",

Until about a decade ago, robotic arms were strictly confined to caged robotic work cells to protect the safety of people who might otherwise be harmed by high robotic joint torques/forces. The past decade has seen a couple of trends where a cage for safety is no longer practical. The first trend is robotic mobility. It's not practical to build a fixed cage around a mobile robot, considering, for example, Vecna's BEAR robot, designed to rescue wounded soldiers from an active battlefield, or the iRobot Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner. The second trend is a growing reliance on robots that are necessarily in direct contact with people, such as medical patients during robotically-assisted surgery or rehabilitation. For example, Barrett's robotic WAM arm reduces the invasiveness of knee-implant surgery to improve outcome and shorten hospital recovery time. But robot surgery requires direct physical contact between robot and patient, again challenging the role of a cage. The talk will cover these examples and others that show the recent trends away from traditional fixed robotic work cells in cages. It will also show innovative ways to improve safety as these trends continue.",

As often happens in mathematics, theory originally developed for its own sake has led to some surprising practical applications.

Every programmer has his list favorite features, but usually there is no language that covers all of them. Zimbu takes the good ideas of existing languages, drops the bad parts and adds a few brand new ideas. The goal is to make a language that builds upon all the learnings from working with existing languages. And to have fun creating something new.

Participatory culture thrives on the sharing of diverse opinions among large populations. However: The amount of data can be overwhelming. News and blog sites often generate hundreds or thousands of comments. Websites often attract people with like-minded viewpoints, which can reinforce biases and produce \"cyberpolarization.\" Thoughtful moderates are often shouted down by extremists. Opinion Space 2.0 uses new data-visualization models and statistical analysis to address these problems. Every participant represents a \"point of view\" on a visual opinion map. This map is not based on geography or predetermined categories, but on similarity of opinion; those who agree on basic issues are neighbors, and those who are far apart have agreed to disagree. The map is designed to 'depolarize' discussions by including all participants on a level playing field. You can instantly see where you stand in relation to other participants, and, by reviewing their comments, you help the community highlight the most insightful ideas. Opinion Space is a general tool that could potentially be used to collect and visualize user opinions on topics ranging from politics to parenting, from art to zoology.",

From small proprietary trading firms and hedge funds up to the largest multinational investment banks, complex algorithms and cutting edge hardware make multi-million-dollar decisions in microseconds--and humans struggle to keep up. But what's behind the headlines of the \"Flash Crash\" and star programmers being offered $400,000 salaries? In this talk, Andrew Brook will explain what automated trading is (and what it isn't), what's driving its growth and examine some of the technical problems that arise when you entrust machines with significant, real-time decision-making. Finally, we'll look at the recent growth into non-traditional data sources such as market sentiment and event-based trading and their relationship to collaborative computing and social networking.",

The 'J' part definitely slants the service selection and the 'V' part means that underneath the illusion there's a lot of really cruddy stuff. The success of these illusions has led to the real popularity of JVMs. In particular, JVMs are probably the most popular way to distribute ready-to-use GC technology to the masses, and the 2nd most popular way to distribute ready-to-use compilation technology (just behind \"gcc\" I'm guessing). Just what are these illusions? The illusion that bytecodes are fast and have a reasonable cost model : (machine code generation, profiling, JIT'ing). The illusion that you can quickly change the program at any time (dynamic class loading, deoptimization, re-JIT'ing). The illusion of infinite memory (Garbage Collection). The illusion of a consistent threading and memory model (the JMM, volatiles, locks). The illusion of quick time access (i.e. Intel's\n\"rdtsc\" is mostly useless for time). The illusion that these other illusions all work on all sorts of machines from cell phones to 1000-cpu mainframes (it's kinda sorta mostly true). But these are not enough! The People cry out for more illusions! The illusion of an Infinite Stack (tail recursion), the illusion that running-code-is-data (closures), the illusion that Integers are as cheap as 'ints' (autoboxing optimizations), or that BigIntegers are as cheap as 'ints' (tagged ints), the illusion that memory supports atomic update (software transactional memory), or the illusion that with enough hard work other language implementation experts can make a JVM run utterly different languages (invokedynamic). Meanwhile, JVM engineers labor under the illusion that they can maintain this giant piggy pile of code, and maybe even expand the provided services without it collapsing under it's own weight. Here's my take on what services could & should be provided by a JVM, what services probably belong to the next layer up (STMs, new concurrency models), and what services belong to the next layer down (fast time management, sane thread scheduling).",

The downside is that they are very hard to get right. I have been working on writing some nonblocking utilities over the last year (open sourced on SourceForge in the high-scale-lib project) and have made some progress toward a coding style that can be used to build a variety of NB data structures: hash tables, sets, work queues, and bit vectors. These data structures scale much better than even the concurrent JDK software utilities while providing the same correctness guarantees. They usually have similar overheads at the low end while scaling incredibly well on high-end hardware. The coding style is still very immature but shows clear promise. It stems from a handful of basic premises: You don\u0092t hide payload during updates; any thread can complete (or ignore) any in-progress update; use flat arrays for quick access and broadest-possible striping; and use parallel, concurrent, incremental array copy. At the core is a simple state-machine description of the update logic.",

Nearly all programmers occasionally function as API designers, whether they know it or not. A well-designed API can be a great asset to the organization that wrote it and to all who use it. Good APIs increase the pleasure and productivity of the developers who use them and the quality of the software they produce. Conversely, poorly written APIs are a constant thorn in the developer's side, and can cause severe harm. Given the importance of good API design, surprisingly little has been written on the subject.

The challenge now is - all this talk of ebooks and selling your work digitally. this should be a windfall for creators, but the gatekeepers of managing this crimp that restricts the distribution to people who've paid for it (or the attempt to) as well as all the quality content that is out there that is free to read (legally or otherwise) - the challenge is to have enough of that intangible emotive content into your work that the image alone will feel it has value.",

Greek mathematicians formed the basis of modern geometry using inspirations from Babylonian and Egyptian discoveries, and their axioms started a revolution that led to a better understanding of many physical phenomena. Among many of the fields that profited from these developments was astronomy, the evolution of which fundamentally transformed society and culture. For instance, understanding the motion of planets and mapping them led to advances in navigation, which led to economical and social progress.\nFast forwarding to the 20th century, robotics have flourished from an idea to an existential part of our society. Coping with high volumes of products, in order to keep pace with the extremely large demand that we consume, would be unthinkable without robots in our modern world. However, the robots of today are very much like the explorers of the pre-Greek era: due to their limitations in navigation, they are very inefficient, and their economical impact is only a fraction of what it could be if we were to make them cheaper and more flexible. It is thus the right time to devise new mapping theories that are essential for a \"post-robotic\" generation of robots that can localize, navigate, and manipulate more efficiently. Our new playground is not astronomy, but a virtual representation of the world obtained using precise sensing devices that sample 3D collections of points on every surface they touch. We call these collections, \"point clouds\", and the new \"science\" that acquires, interprets them, and extracts meaningful information from them, \"3D point cloud processing.\"",

Even very basic ones like variables, math, or mixins, aren\u2019t usable yet due to the slow W3C standardization. But when it comes to writing large-scale CSS, the need for keeping CSS files maintainable becomes stronger and leads to new techniques to deal with these weaknesses. OOCSS and pre-processors like Sass are two recent and brilliant techniques that make CSS development much smarter. During his talk, Verrecchia will explain how they both work and how to combine them together to get the best of both worlds.",
